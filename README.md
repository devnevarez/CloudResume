# CloudResume
Online Resume
A project guided by the website: https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/aws/
This project is designed to help bridge the gap from textbook knowledge to real world knowledge. 
The project does this by demonstrating:
How code is integrated when creating a website
Running and testing code with GitHub
The different coding languages an aspiring Cloud Engineer should familiarize themselves with to be successful
Migrating a static website to a cloud host (in this project I will be using AWS)
Automation using Infrastructure as Code (IAC)
