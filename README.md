# CloudResume
Online Resume
A project guided by the website: https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/aws/
This project is designed to help bridge the gap from textbook knowledge to real world knowledge. 
The project does this by demonstrating:
how code is integrated when creating a website,
running and testing code with GitHub,
the different coding languages an aspiring Cloud Engineer should familiarize themselves with to be successful,
migrating a static website to a cloud host (in this project I will be using AWS),
configuring security and navigating through AWS services to deploy a website using SSL certificates and HTTPS,
Automation using Infrastructure as Code (IAC).
